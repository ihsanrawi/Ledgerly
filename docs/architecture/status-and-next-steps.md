# Status and Next Steps

**Current Status:** Architecture validation completed - CONDITIONAL PASS (74% overall completion)

**Architect Checklist Results:**
- Backend architecture: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- Frontend architecture: ❌ BLOCKED - Missing frontend-architecture.md document
- Overall pass rate: 74% across 10 validation sections
- Validation date: 2025-10-04

**CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix Before Development):**

1. **Create Frontend Architecture Document** (BLOCKING for Epic 3+)
   - Status: Referenced at line 20 but NOT FOUND
   - Impact: AI agents lack guidance for 40% of application (entire Angular frontend)
   - Required sections: Component hierarchy, state management patterns, routing, accessibility (WCAG AA)
   - Recommendation: Use `*create-front-end-architecture` command with detailed specifications
   - Deadline: Before Epic 3 (Dashboard) implementation
   - See: Comprehensive frontend architecture recommendations provided in validation report

2. **Specify Accessibility Implementation** (BLOCKING for WCAG AA compliance)
   - Status: PRD requires WCAG AA but implementation details missing
   - Impact: Non-compliance with stated requirements, potential user exclusion
   - Required: ARIA patterns, keyboard nav matrix, focus management strategy, a11y testing tools
   - Deadline: Before Epic 3 UI development

3. **Document Week 1 Tauri Validation Checklist** (BLOCKING for Epic 1)
   - Status: Mentioned but not detailed
   - Impact: Week 1 validation failure could force Electron fallback, invalidating architecture
   - Required: Test cases for process spawning, file I/O, cross-platform builds
   - Deadline: Week 1, Day 1 of Epic 1

**HIGH-PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS (Should Fix for Quality):**

4. **Enhance Frontend Testing Strategy**
   - Jest configuration and component testing patterns
   - Visual regression testing consideration
   - Frontend test coverage currently underspecified (35% completeness)

5. **Complete Deployment Automation**
   - Document GitHub Actions workflows (build.yml, release.yml)
   - Create self-hosted runner setup scripts
   - Add code signing certificate management

6. **Formalize Architecture Decision Records**
   - Use ADR (Architecture Decision Record) pattern
   - Create docs/architecture/decisions/ folder
   - Retroactively document key decisions (Tauri vs Electron, VSA vs Clean)

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. ~~Run architect-checklist to validate completeness~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. **CREATE frontend-architecture.md** (CRITICAL - see validation report for detailed recommendations)
3. Extract coding-standards.md and tech-stack.md to separate files (OPTIONAL)
4. Create docs/api/openapi.yaml with full API specification
5. Address accessibility implementation gaps
6. Begin Epic 1 (Foundation) implementation

**Critical Validation Gates:**
- **Week 1:** Tauri validation (process execution, file I/O, cross-platform builds) - NEEDS DETAILED CHECKLIST
- **Week 6:** Performance testing with 50K transactions

**Architecture Readiness Assessment:**
- Backend-focused epics (1, 2 partial, 4, 5, 6 partial): ✅ READY
- Frontend-heavy epics (3, 7): ⚠️ BLOCKED until frontend architecture documented
- Security & Error Handling: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE
- AI Agent Implementation Suitability: ✅ EXCELLENT (95% pass rate)
- Accessibility Implementation: ❌ INCOMPLETE (40% pass rate)

**Next Recommended Action:**
Run `*create-front-end-architecture` command in new chat context with frontend architecture recommendations from validation report to unblock Epic 3 (Dashboard) implementation.

**Alignment with PRD Goals:** 97% (Enhanced with comprehensive architecture coverage)
