## TOP 5 RISKS BY SEVERITY

### 1. **CRITICAL - Household Multi-User Access Not Architected** üî¥

**Risk:** PRD Persona 3 (non-technical household member) requires read-only access to view financial data. No authentication/authorization architecture exists.

**Evidence:** PRD lines 66-79 define Persona 3 with goal: "Answer basic questions: current balance, spending this month, budget status." Security section 6.1 shows no multi-user support.

**Impact:** Without read-only mode, Persona 3 can delete transactions, modify categories, or corrupt .hledger files. Market differentiation claim ("enable household financial transparency") unsupported.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Immediate (Pre-Development):** Clarify if Persona 3 is Phase 2 or MVP. PRD lines 66-79 say "Phase 2" but also lists as primary use case.
2. **Architecture Addition:** Add authentication (local PIN/password), authorization (viewer vs editor roles), UI mode switching (read-only vs full access).
3. **Timeline Impact:** +1-2 weeks if added to MVP.

### 2. **HIGH - hledger GPL Licensing Not Validated for Commercial Distribution** üü†

**Risk:** hledger is GPL-licensed (copyleft). Embedding in Tauri app may require Ledgerly source code release under GPL.

**Evidence:** Tech stack specifies hledger 1.32.3 as embedded binary. GPL licensing not mentioned in architecture or PRD.

**Impact:** Cannot sell proprietary desktop app without GPL compliance. Community backlash if licensing ignored.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Immediate:** Legal review of GPL + Tauri combination. hledger binary distribution likely OK (separate process), but confirm.
2. **Alternative:** Ship hledger as separate download, not embedded. User installs hledger CLI separately.
3. **Timeline Impact:** If licensing issue found, 2-3 weeks to redesign distribution model.

### 3. **MEDIUM - SQLCipher Encryption Key Storage Undefined** üü°

**Risk:** SQLite encrypted with SQLCipher (AES-256), but key storage/unlock mechanism not documented. If key stored in code, encryption useless.

**Evidence:** Tech stack lists SQLCipher 4.5.6. No mention of password entry UI, key derivation, or secure storage.

**Impact:** False security promise. User believes data encrypted but key recoverable from binary.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Architecture Decision Needed:** User enters password at app start (PBKDF2 key derivation). Password hashed and used as SQLCipher key.
2. **Alternative:** No encryption in MVP (defer to Phase 2). .hledger files already unencrypted.
3. **Timeline Impact:** +3-5 days for password UI + key derivation logic.

### 4. **MEDIUM - .hledger.bak Files Unencrypted (Security Inconsistency)** üü°

**Risk:** SQLite cache encrypted with SQLCipher, but .hledger.bak backup files unencrypted. Attacker recovers financial data from backups.

**Evidence:** Architecture specifies automatic .hledger.bak creation (atomic write pattern) but no encryption. SQLCipher encrypts cache.

**Impact:** Security theater - encrypted cache but unencrypted backups defeats purpose.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Align Security Model:** Either encrypt .bak files (gpg/age encryption) or remove SQLCipher (both plaintext).
2. **Recommendation:** Remove SQLCipher from MVP. .hledger files already plaintext (PTA requirement). Encrypt everything in Phase 2 if needed.
3. **Timeline Impact:** None if removing SQLCipher (simplifies architecture).

### 5. **MEDIUM - Runtime Performance Monitoring Missing** üü°

**Risk:** Dashboard must load in <2s (NFR1). No runtime monitoring to validate in production. Performance regressions undetected.

**Evidence:** DevTools Performance profiler mentioned for testing. No runtime metrics (dashboard load time, hledger query latency, cache hit ratio).

**Impact:** Users experience slowdowns but no telemetry to diagnose. Can't validate NFR1 compliance post-launch.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Add Local Metrics:** Track dashboard load times, hledger execution times, cache hits/misses. Store in SQLite, display in Settings.
2. **No Telemetry:** Privacy-first positioning forbids external telemetry. Local-only metrics acceptable.
3. **Timeline Impact:** +2-3 days for metrics collection service.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### ‚úÖ MUST-FIX ITEMS - RESOLVED (2025-10-04)

**All 3 critical architectural decisions have been finalized and architecture documents updated:**

1. **‚úÖ RESOLVED: Persona 3 Multi-User Scope**
   - **Decision:** Deferred to Phase 2
   - **Rationale:** MVP focuses on solo power-user workflows (Persona 1); multi-user auth adds 1-2 weeks complexity
   - **Updates Made:**
     - Added FR25 to PRD Phase 2 requirements
     - Updated architecture.md Security section with Phase 2 multi-user plan
   - **Impact:** No auth system in MVP; single-user assumption throughout codebase

2. **‚úÖ RESOLVED: hledger GPL Licensing**
   - **Decision:** Bundle hledger binary (Option A - separate subprocess model)
   - **Rationale:** GPL applies to linked code, not separate processes; Tauri spawns hledger via IPC (GPL-compliant)
   - **Updates Made:**
     - Updated Tech Stack table: hledger noted as "embedded binary, separate subprocess"
     - Added "hledger GPL Licensing" section to Dependency Security
     - Clarified distribution strategy and legal compliance
   - **Impact:** User convenience (bundled binary); GPL firewall via process boundary; LICENSE file attribution required

3. **‚úÖ RESOLVED: SQLCipher Key Management**
   - **Decision:** Remove SQLCipher (use standard better-sqlite3)
   - **Rationale:** Encrypting SQLite cache but not .hledger files = security inconsistency; aligns with PTA plaintext philosophy
   - **Updates Made:**
     - Updated Tech Stack: SQLCipher removed, better-sqlite3 9.x added
     - Updated Data Protection section: All files plaintext, Phase 2 may add full-disk encryption
     - Removed password unlock UI from architecture
   - **Impact:** Simplified architecture; no password prompts; faster development; user can use OS-level encryption (BitLocker, FileVault)

### SHOULD-FIX FOR BETTER QUALITY

4. **‚úÖ RESOLVED: Align Encryption Model**
   - **Status:** Completed as part of MUST-FIX #3
   - **Decision:** All files plaintext (SQLite cache, .hledger, .hledger.bak)
   - **Outcome:** Consistent security model; aligns with PTA transparency requirements

5. **Add Runtime Performance Metrics** üîß
   - **Action:** Implement local metrics service (dashboard load time, hledger query latency, cache hit ratio).
   - **Display:** Settings page "Performance Stats" section.

6. **Document Tauri File System Permissions** üîß
   - **Action:** Specify which directories accessible (user Documents/ only? entire file system?).
   - **Security:** Apply least privilege principle (scope Tauri permissions to ledger data directory).

### NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS

7. **Add Visual Regression Testing** üí°
   - **Action:** Integrate Percy or Chromatic for Chart.js rendering validation.
   - **Benefit:** Catch charting bugs before users see them.

8. **Specify Dependency Update Cadence** üí°
   - **Action:** Define quarterly dependency reviews, breaking change strategy.
   - **Tool:** Enable Dependabot for automated PR creation.

9. **Add Security Testing** üí°
   - **Action:** npm audit / dotnet list package --vulnerable in CI/CD.
   - **Benefit:** Catch known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## AI IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### STRENGTHS FOR AI AGENT IMPLEMENTATION

‚úÖ **VSA Structure Exceptional for AI Agents**
- Each feature slice maps to 1 PRD epic ‚Üí clear work unit boundaries
- Frontend features mirror backend slices ‚Üí consistent mental model
- Templates provided for components, services, state ‚Üí scaffolding reduces ambiguity

‚úÖ **Explicit Validation Gates Prevent AI Drift**
- Week 1: Tauri viability ‚Üí forces early validation, prevents late pivot
- Week 6: 50K transaction performance test ‚Üí validates scalability assumptions
- hledger check on every write ‚Üí enforces correctness at runtime

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Sequence Diagrams Guide Implementation**
- CSV import workflow (12 steps) shows exact handler sequence
- Dashboard load shows parallel queries ‚Üí AI understands concurrency needs
- Add transaction shows atomic write pattern ‚Üí error handling clear

‚úÖ **Developer Standards Eliminate Common Pitfalls**
- 10 critical rules with examples (no signal mutation, readonly public signals, TrackBy, etc.)
- Enforced by linters (ESLint, Roslyn) ‚Üí AI agent violations caught immediately

### AREAS NEEDING ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION

‚ö†Ô∏è **Adaptive Learning Algorithm Needs Pseudo-Code Expansion**
- Current: "Boost Confidence: NewConfidence = (TimesAccepted / TimesApplied) * 1.1"
- Missing: Competing rule creation logic (when to create new rule vs adjust existing)
- Missing: Rule pruning strategy (when to archive low-confidence rules)
- **Recommendation:** Add complete algorithm with decision tree in AdaptiveLearningService component spec.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cash Flow Prediction Algorithm Lacks Detail**
- Current: "For each day (next 30/60/90): Check for recurring tx on this date"
- Missing: How to handle variable amounts (utilities $85-$120)?
- Missing: Confidence scoring calculation (what makes a prediction high/low confidence)?
- **Recommendation:** Add detailed algorithm with edge cases in DetectRecurring slice spec.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Tauri Integration Patterns Incomplete**
- Current: "Tauri API abstraction" with `openFileDialog()` example
- Missing: How to detect Tauri environment (window.__TAURI__ check)?
- Missing: Graceful fallback when running in browser (dev mode)?
- **Recommendation:** Add TauriService complete implementation with browser compatibility layer.
