# Quality Gate Decision - Story 2.1
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.1"
story_title: "Collect Bank CSV Test Samples"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Strong documentation quality and anonymization, but target sample count (20+) not fully met (11/20). Scope reduction pragmatic for MVP, but noted as CONCERNS rather than PASS."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-10-08T00:00:00Z"

# Waiver status
waiver: { active: false }

# Top issues identified
top_issues:
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Sample count is 55% of target (11/20+). Dev accepted scope reduction citing format diversity achieved."
    suggested_action: "Monitor parser development in Story 2.2. If format gaps discovered, collect additional samples before Story 2.3."

# Risk summary
risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 1, low: 0 }
  highest:
    score: 6
    category: "Scope Reduction Risk"
    rationale: "11 samples cover major format variations but may miss edge cases from regional banks or investment accounts"
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor:
      - "Track parser failures in Story 2.2 to identify missing format patterns"
      - "Add samples incrementally if gaps discovered during development"

# Evidence from review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 0  # No executable tests (documentation story)
  artifacts_reviewed: 23  # 11 CSV + 8 metadata + 4 docs
  risks_identified: 1

    ac_gaps: [1]  # AC1 partially met (11/20)

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Anonymization validated via automated grep and manual inspection. No PII, account numbers, or sensitive data found."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "N/A for documentation story. Test data files are appropriately small (<10KB each)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Malformed samples and edge cases support robust error handling testing in Story 2.2."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation structure with metadata files, clear categorization, and usage guidance. Column mapping JSON enables extensible parser development."

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "If Story 2.2 parser encounters unsupported formats, add targeted CSV samples to address gaps"
      refs: ["tests/TestData/CsvSamples/"]
    - action: "Consider adding investment account CSV samples (brokerage, retirement) in Epic 3 if user requests that feature"
      refs: ["docs/prd/epic-details.md"]

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptional documentation quality: CSV_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md is comprehensive (411 lines, 8 sections) with C# parser implementation guidance"
    - "Statistical analysis of format distribution (83% comma-delimited, 50% MM/DD/YYYY dates) informs parser prioritization"
    - "Column mapping JSON with confidence scores ready for auto-detection algorithm"
    - "Strong categorization: standard (4), edge-cases (4), malformed (3) with metadata files"
    - "Perfect anonymization: No sensitive data detected via automated and manual review"
    - "Practical usage notes for developers (how to reference fixtures in tests)"

  concerns:
    - "Sample count 55% of target (11/20+): While Dev's rationale about format diversity is sound, additional samples may uncover edge cases"
    - "No samples from: Investment accounts, PayPal/Venmo, Canadian/UK banks, Amex/Discover cards"
    - "INVENTORY.md notes pending collection methods (Reddit post, personal network) but acknowledges delays"

  improvements_applied: []  # QA cannot modify test data; would need Dev Agent

  improvements_suggested:
    - priority: low
      action: "Add test plan section to CSV_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md describing how Story 2.2 will validate against these 11 samples"
      rationale: "Helps Story 2.2 dev understand expected parser test coverage"
    - priority: low
      action: "Document rationale for 11/20 acceptance in INVENTORY.md (currently only in story Dev Notes)"
      rationale: "Future developers need context for scope decision"

# Compliance checks
compliance:
  coding_standards:
    status: PASS
    notes: "N/A - no code changes. Documentation follows Markdown standards."
  project_structure:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test data location (tests/TestData/CsvSamples/) aligns with existing structure. File naming convention consistent."
  testing_strategy:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fixtures support test pyramid strategy (unit tests with standard samples, integration tests with edge cases, error handling with malformed)."
  all_acs_met:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "4/5 ACs fully met (AC2-AC5). AC1 partially met (11/20 samples = 55%)."
