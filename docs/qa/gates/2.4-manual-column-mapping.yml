# Gate Decision Rationale
gate_decision_rationale: |
  Gate decision: CONCERNS (not FAIL) because:

  ✅ Story Quality: EXCELLENT
     - All 6 ACs clearly defined and testable
     - Comprehensive Dev Notes with tech stack, architecture, data models, API endpoints
     - No ambiguity in requirements or acceptance criteria
     - Ready for development without clarification needed

  ✅ Risk Awareness: EXCELLENT
     - 18 risks identified with comprehensive risk profile
     - Mitigation strategies defined for all critical and high risks
     - Test design addresses risk coverage (24 P0 tests)

  ✅ Test Strategy: EXCELLENT
     - 47 test scenarios designed across all levels (unit, integration, E2E)
     - Risk-based prioritization (51% P0 tests for critical risks)
     - Clear test execution order (fail fast approach)
     - Test data requirements documented

  ⚠️ CONCERNS (not PASS) because:
     - 2 critical risks (score 9) require careful mitigation during implementation
     - High complexity story (18 risks, 47 tests, 8-10 day effort)
     - 4 high-risk issues (score 6) must be addressed before production
     - Critical risks (DATA-001, TECH-001) could cause financial data corruption if not handled properly

  📋 Recommended Actions Before Starting Implementation:
     1. Team risk review meeting to acknowledge critical risks (DATA-001, TECH-001)
     2. Confirm P0 test-first approach (implement critical tests before features)
     3. Add explicit checkpoints for risk mitigation validation during development

  🎯 Path to PASS:
     After implementation, gate will be re-evaluated based on:
     - All 24 P0 tests passing (critical risk mitigation validated)
     - Code review confirms DATA-001 and TECH-001 mitigations implemented
     - Integration tests verify bank matching disambiguation logic works
     - E2E tests validate complete user workflows

  This story is READY FOR DEVELOPMENT with heightened risk awareness.
