    status: PASS
    notes: "File I/O security validated, proper input validation, no injection risks, SHA256 integrity tracking"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async I/O throughout, timeout protection, efficient string building, retry logic with exponential backoff"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Automatic rollback on validation failure, retry logic for transient errors, backup before every write, correlation IDs for tracing"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code readability, single responsibility principle, high test coverage (100% formatter, 80%+ file writer), XML documentation on all APIs"

    - action: "Consider implementing concurrent write protection (file locking) for multi-process scenarios"
      refs: ["src/Ledgerly.Api/Common/Hledger/HledgerFileWriter.cs"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current implementation handles single-process atomic writes well. Future story may need inter-process coordination if multiple instances run simultaneously."
