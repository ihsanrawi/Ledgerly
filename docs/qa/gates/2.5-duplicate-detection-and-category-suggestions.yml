# Quality Gate Decision for Story 2.5
schema: 1
story: "2.5"
story_title: "Duplicate Detection and Category Suggestions"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All critical and medium-severity issues resolved. Comprehensive test coverage (89 tests). Low-severity test data creation can be addressed as needed."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-10-17T00:00:00Z"

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "GetCategorySuggestionsHandler called SaveChangesAsync inside loop (N database writes for N transactions)"
    suggested_action: "FIXED: Refactored to batch save after all matches - single database write"
    status: RESOLVED
    owner: qa

  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "ImportRule.TimesApplied incremented during suggestion but never decremented if user rejects, causing permanently inaccurate confidence scores"
    suggested_action: "FIXED: Moved TimesApplied increment from suggestion phase to accept phase in AcceptCategorySuggestionHandler"
    status: RESOLVED
    owner: dev

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing FluentValidation validators for DetectDuplicatesQuery and GetCategorySuggestionsQuery (violates coding standard #10)"
    suggested_action: "FIXED: Added DetectDuplicatesQueryValidator and GetCategorySuggestionsQueryValidator"
    status: RESOLVED
    owner: dev

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Integration tests and test data CSV samples not created (deferred from tasks)"
    suggested_action: "Create test data samples and integration tests as needed for future testing"

# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SHA256 hashing implementation correct. EF Core parameterized queries prevent SQL injection. No regex support prevents ReDoS. FluentValidation validators added for all queries."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Critical N+1 database write issue RESOLVED (batched saves). Duplicate detection uses proper indexing. All performance concerns addressed."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TimesApplied data integrity issue RESOLVED - now only incremented during user accept action, not during suggestion retrieval. Confidence calculations accurate."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Excellent test coverage (89 tests, 100% passing). Documentation complete. AAA pattern followed in tests."
