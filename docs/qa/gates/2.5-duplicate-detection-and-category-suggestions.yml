# Quality Gate Decision for Story 2.5
schema: 1
story: "2.5"
story_title: "Duplicate Detection and Category Suggestions"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Critical performance issue fixed during review. Missing FluentValidation validators and data integrity concern with TimesApplied tracking requires follow-up."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "GetCategorySuggestionsHandler called SaveChangesAsync inside loop (N database writes for N transactions)"
    suggested_action: "FIXED: Refactored to batch save after all matches - single database write"
    owner: qa

  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "ImportRule.TimesApplied incremented during suggestion but never decremented if user rejects, causing permanently inaccurate confidence scores"
    suggested_action: "Add rejection tracking or only increment TimesApplied when user accepts/rejects (not during suggestion phase)"
    owner: dev

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing FluentValidation validators for DetectDuplicatesQuery and GetCategorySuggestionsQuery (violates coding standard #10)"
    suggested_action: "Add validators to ensure input validation consistency across all commands/queries"
    owner: dev

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Integration tests and test data CSV samples not created (deferred from tasks)"
    suggested_action: "Create test data samples and integration tests before production deployment"

# Evidence from review
evidence:

# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SHA256 hashing implementation correct. EF Core parameterized queries prevent SQL injection. No regex support prevents ReDoS. Pattern length validation recommended but not critical."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Critical N+1 database write issue FIXED during review (batched saves). Duplicate detection uses proper indexing. No other performance concerns."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "TimesApplied tracking has data integrity issue - incremented during suggestions but never decremented on rejection. Confidence scores will drift over time."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Good test coverage (89 tests). Documentation complete. AAA pattern followed in tests."

  future:
    - action: "Create integration tests and test data CSV samples before production"

    - action: "Add pattern length validation (max 200 chars) in CreateImportRuleCommand validator"
