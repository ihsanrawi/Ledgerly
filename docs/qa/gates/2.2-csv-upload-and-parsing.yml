# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - File size limit (50MB) prevents resource exhaustion
      - Extension validation (.csv only) prevents malicious uploads
      - Content-Type validation implemented
      - Streaming parsing prevents memory issues
      - CsvHelper handles formula injection
      - Correlation IDs for tracing (no PII logged)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Streaming CSV parsing for large files
      - Timeout protection (30s)
      - Preview limited to 10 rows
      - Delimiter/encoding detection on first 5 lines only
      - Meets NFR2 target: parse 1,000 rows in <5 seconds
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - All exception types handled with specific messages
      - Timeout distinguishes user cancellation vs system timeout
      - Network errors handled gracefully
      - Parse errors include line numbers
      - Cancellation token support
      - Graceful degradation for encoding/delimiter detection
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - VSA pattern with clear boundaries
      - Single Responsibility Principle followed
      - Dependency injection for testability
      - XML documentation on all public classes
      - 100% business logic covered by tests
      - AAA pattern in all tests

# Final assessment
final_assessment: |
  Story 2.2 demonstrates excellent engineering quality with comprehensive test coverage,
  robust error handling, and strong adherence to architectural patterns. The implementation
  is production-ready with all acceptance criteria validated through automated tests.

  The single coding standards violation (console.error) was identified and remediated
  during review with test validation confirming no regression.

  Technical debt items are low priority and acceptable for MVP release. The feature
  provides a solid foundation for Story 2.3 (column mapping) to build upon.

  Recommended action: Mark story as DONE.
