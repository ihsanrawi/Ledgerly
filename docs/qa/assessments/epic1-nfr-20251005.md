## Security Assessment

**Status:** CONCERNS

### Findings

✅ **PASS Areas:**
- Binary verification via SHA256 checksums (Story 1.2)
- File system permissions validation before .hledger access
- No hardcoded secrets policy enforced
- FluentValidation configured for input validation

⚠️ **CONCERNS:**
1. **hledger Binary Extraction Security**
   - Risk: Malicious binary substitution during extraction
   - Mitigation needed: Verify SHA256 *after* extraction, not just download
   - Impact: HIGH (financial data manipulation)

2. **Cross-Platform Permission Setting**
   - Risk: Improper chmod on macOS/Linux could allow unauthorized execution
   - Mitigation needed: Verify permissions after setting (Story 1.2 AC #2)
   - Impact: MEDIUM

3. **Tauri CSP Not Validated Early**
   - Risk: XSS vulnerabilities if CSP misconfigured
   - Mitigation needed: Add CSP validation test in Story 1.5
   - Impact: MEDIUM

### Recommendations

**Critical (Fix in Epic 1):**
- Add post-extraction SHA256 verification test
- Add permission validation test (verify binary is executable but not world-writable)

**Important (Defer to Epic 2):**
- Add CSP header validation in E2E smoke test

---

## Performance Assessment

**Status:** PASS

### Findings

✅ **PASS Areas:**
- Cold start target <3s (NFR4) - testable in Story 1.5 cross-platform smoke test
- hledger process execution design supports <2s dashboard loads (validates in Epic 3)
- Atomic file operations prevent blocking I/O

✔️ **No Concerns**
- Test infrastructure includes performance profiling hooks
- Simple balance display (Story 1.5) provides baseline for future benchmarks

### Recommendations

**Nice-to-Have:**
- Document baseline cold start times in Story 1.5 smoke test report

---

## Reliability Assessment

**Status:** CONCERNS

### Findings

✅ **PASS Areas:**
- Atomic write strategy (temp file → validate → rename) prevents corruption (Story 1.4)
- Automatic .hledger.bak backup before writes (Story 1.4)
- Error handling pattern defined: restore .bak on `hledger check` failure

⚠️ **CONCERNS:**
1. **hledger Binary Not Found Recovery**
   - Risk: App unusable if binary extraction fails (Story 1.2)
   - Mitigation needed: Add re-extraction retry logic + user-facing error with recovery instructions
   - Impact: HIGH (app non-functional)

2. **Cross-Platform Process Execution Failure Handling**
   - Risk: Week 1 decision point requires fallback plan
   - Mitigation needed: Define "pivot to Electron" criteria explicitly (Story 1.2 AC #6)
   - Impact: CRITICAL (architecture decision)

3. **Incomplete Error Recovery Test Coverage**
   - Risk: Story 1.4 AC #6 tests restore on validation failure, but not on write failure
   - Mitigation needed: Add test for write failure → .bak restore
   - Impact: MEDIUM

### Recommendations

**Critical (Fix in Epic 1):**
- Add HledgerBinaryNotFoundException recovery workflow (Story 1.2)
- Define explicit Tauri process execution success criteria (e.g., "All 3 platforms execute hledger --version in <1s")

**Important (Defer to Epic 2):**
- Add write failure simulation test (disk full, permissions denied)

---

## Maintainability Assessment

**Status:** PASS

### Findings

✅ **PASS Areas:**
- Test infrastructure comprehensive (Story 1.3):
  - Unit tests: xUnit + NSubstitute for .NET
  - Frontend tests: Jest with Signals support
  - Integration tests: Real hledger binary execution
  - E2E stubs: Playwright (full suite Epic 7)
- CI/CD with coverage reporting (70%+ target aligns with test strategy)
- VSA folder structure enforces feature slice modularity (Story 1.1)

✔️ **Strengths:**
- Co-located tests (`{Feature}.Tests/`) enable test-after workflow
- Wolverine test harness supports isolated handler testing
- Documentation requirements: VSA structure documented in repo (Story 1.1 AC #6)

### Recommendations

**Nice-to-Have:**
- Add test coverage baseline enforcement in CI (fail if <70% for new code)

## Critical Issues (Must-Fix Before Epic 2)

### 1. Binary Extraction Security Gap
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** Post-extraction SHA256 verification missing
**Fix:** Add test in Story 1.2 integration suite:
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task HledgerBinary_AfterExtraction_MatchesExpectedHash()
{
    var extractedPath = await _binaryManager.ExtractBinary();
    var actualHash = ComputeSHA256(extractedPath);
    Assert.Equal(ExpectedHashes[Platform], actualHash);
}
```
**Effort:** 2 hours

### 2. Binary Not Found Recovery Missing
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** No user-facing recovery if extraction fails
**Fix:** Add to HledgerBinaryManager.cs:
```csharp
public async Task<string> EnsureBinaryAvailable()
{
    if (!File.Exists(_binaryPath))
    {
        _logger.Warning("hledger binary not found. Re-extracting...");
        return await ExtractBinary();
    }
    return _binaryPath;
}
```
**Effort:** 3 hours (includes retry UI)

### 3. Tauri Process Execution Decision Criteria Undefined
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Issue:** Story 1.2 AC #6 says "Decision by Week 1" but doesn't define success/failure thresholds
**Fix:** Add explicit criteria:
- **PASS (Continue Tauri):** All 3 platforms execute `hledger --version` successfully
- **FAIL (Pivot Electron):** Any platform fails OR execution time >5s
**Effort:** 1 hour (documentation)

---

## Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Impact)

### 1. Add CSP Validation Test
**Effort:** 1 hour
**Impact:** Catch CSP misconfigurations early
**Implementation:** Add to Story 1.5 smoke test
```typescript
test('Tauri CSP blocks unsafe inline scripts', async () => {
    await expect(page.evaluate(() => eval('alert("XSS")'))).rejects.toThrow();
});
```

### 2. Document Cold Start Baseline
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** Enables regression detection
**Implementation:** Add to Story 1.5 test report:
```markdown
## Performance Baseline (Epic 1)
- Windows 10: 1.8s cold start
- macOS 13: 1.5s cold start
- Ubuntu 20.04: 2.1s cold start
Target: <3s (NFR4) ✅
```
