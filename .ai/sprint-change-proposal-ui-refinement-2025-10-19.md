# SPRINT CHANGE PROPOSAL
## ai-frontend-prompt.md Integration & UI/UX Process Correction

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Product Owner:** Sarah (PO Agent)
**Change Type:** Process Correction & Technical Debt Remediation
**Status:** âœ… APPROVED & EXECUTED

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Issue:** The [ai-frontend-prompt.md](../docs/ai-frontend-prompt.md) specification was not integrated into the dev agent workflow, causing critical UI/UX deviations in Epic 1-2 components.

**Solution:**
1. âœ… Add ai-frontend-prompt.md to dev agent always-load configuration
2. âœ… Create Story 3.1 (UI/UX Refinement) as FIRST story in Epic 3
3. âœ… Accept Epic 1-2 deviations with structured remediation plan

**Impact:** Prevents future deviations in Epics 3-5 (highest-value epics) while providing clear path to address Epic 1-2 technical debt.

---

## 1. ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Issue Identified

The [ai-frontend-prompt.md](../docs/ai-frontend-prompt.md) specification (481-line comprehensive UI/UX implementation guide) was created but **not integrated into the dev agent workflow**. This caused UI components in Epic 1-2 to deviate from critical design specifications.

### Impact Analysis

**Completed Work Affected:**
- **Epic 1, Story 1.5:** Balance Display UI component
- **Epic 2, Stories 2.2-2.6:** CSV Import flow components (Upload, Column Mapping, Duplicate Detection, Preview)

**Deviation Severity:** **CRITICAL** (per user assessment)
- Missing mobile-first responsive patterns
- Design system inconsistencies (developer aesthetic not fully applied)
- Accessibility gaps (WCAG AA compliance requirements)
- Component-specific implementation details not followed

**Future Work at Risk:**
- **Epic 3:** Dashboard & Interactive Visualizations (heavy UI work)
- **Epic 4:** Transaction Management CRUD (UI components)
- **Epic 5:** Predictive Analytics & Cash Flow Timeline (complex charts/UI)

### Root Cause

[.bmad-core/core-config.yaml](../.bmad-core/core-config.yaml#L16-L22) `devLoadAlwaysFiles` array included design-system.md and front-end-spec.md but was missing ai-frontend-prompt.md.

### Rationale for Chosen Path

**Accept existing deviations (Epic 1-2) + Prevent future deviations (Epic 3-5) + Structured remediation:**
1. **Pragmatic:** No disruption to current progress (no rollbacks)
2. **Preventive:** Fixes root cause before highest-value epics (3-5) begin
3. **Accountable:** Creates dedicated refinement story for Epic 1-2 fixes
4. **Low-risk:** Simple configuration change with clear success criteria

---

## 2. EXECUTED CHANGES

### âœ… Change 1: Updated core-config.yaml

**File:** [.bmad-core/core-config.yaml](../.bmad-core/core-config.yaml)

**Change:** Added clarifying comment to ai-frontend-prompt.md entry

```yaml
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
  - docs/architecture/source-tree.md
  - docs/architecture/design-system.md
  - docs/front-end-spec.md
  - docs/ai-frontend-prompt.md  # AI UI generation guide - MANDATORY for all UI stories
```

**Result:** Dev agent will now load ai-frontend-prompt.md for all future UI stories.

---

### âœ… Change 2: Created Story 3.1 - UI/UX Refinement

**File:** [docs/stories/3.1.ui-ux-refinement-epics-1-2.md](../docs/stories/3.1.ui-ux-refinement-epics-1-2.md)

**Story Number:** 3.1 (FIRST story in Epic 3)

**Story Summary:**
- **Goal:** Align Epic 1-2 UI components with ai-frontend-prompt.md specifications
- **Scope:** Refine Balance Display + CSV Import components (5 components total)
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Must complete before Stories 3.2+
- **Effort:** 12-16 hours

**Key Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Balance Display component refined for mobile-first, accessibility, design system
2. CSV Import components refined per ai-frontend-prompt.md specifications
3. WCAG AA accessibility audit passes (0 critical/serious issues)
4. Responsive design validated at all breakpoints (320px-1920px)
5. Dark mode styling validated across all components

**See:** [docs/stories/3.1.ui-ux-refinement-epics-1-2.md](../docs/stories/3.1.ui-ux-refinement-epics-1-2.md) for detailed tasks and subtasks.

## 9. LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong
1. **Gap in Process:** ai-frontend-prompt.md was created but not integrated into dev agent workflow configuration
2. **Delayed Discovery:** Deviations not caught until Epic 1-2 completion
3. **Documentation Fragmentation:** Multiple UI/UX docs (PRD, design-system.md, front-end-spec.md, ai-frontend-prompt.md) led to confusion about which to prioritize

### What Went Right
1. **Early Detection:** Issue caught before Epic 3 (highest-value UI epic) began
2. **Systematic Response:** Change-checklist process provided structured analysis
3. **Pragmatic Decision:** Accepted technical debt with clear remediation plan (no costly rollbacks)
4. **Prevention:** Configuration fix prevents future deviations in Epics 3-5

### Process Improvements
1. âœ… **Configuration Audit:** Review all devLoadAlwaysFiles entries for completeness
2. ðŸ“‹ **Story Checklist:** Add "Verify all design docs loaded" to UI story pre-implementation checklist
3. ðŸ“‹ **Definition of Done:** Add "UI matches ai-frontend-prompt.md specifications" to UI story DoD
4. ðŸ“‹ **Agent Training:** Ensure dev agent understands document hierarchy (ai-frontend-prompt.md is implementation-level authority for UI)
